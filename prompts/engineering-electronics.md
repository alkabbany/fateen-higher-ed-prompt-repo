### A prompt for designing lecture slides on the device's physics fundamentals of MOSFETs.

**Submitted by:** Ahmad Al-Kabbany


**Use Case:** Curriculum Design

**Description:**
I am a university professor, currently teaching 2nd year engineering students the fundamentals of MOSFET operations. I am seeking your help in designing lecture slides on this topic.

I would like the slides to start by an outline that help the audience see the big picture in the very beginning of the lecture. Then, I usually prefer to give a glimpse on the history of MOSFETs, specifically the contributions of Mohamed Attallah, the Egyptian American inventor, in advancing our knowledge on MOSFETs.

Afterward, I want to highlight the construction of MOSFETs, which would serve as a good intro for clarifying the principal differences between BJTs and MOSFETs. Specifically, elaborating on how the device construction impacts its physics is expected to be helpful in this regard.

Following this part, I like to delve deeper into the relation between the terminal voltages and the drain current, before proving the I-V characteristics of MOSFETs--specifically, the drain current against the Vds and Vgs. The slides should end at the point where students are ready to get introduced to the concepts of transconductance and second order effects in MOSFETs.

I am expecting detailed and clear referral to references for online resources if you used them to prepare the slides. I am also expecting suggestions for visuals that I can add at relevant location throughout the presentation. Finally, the quality of flow and storytelling is of paramount importance. Also, the referral to any real-world figures together with their implications, e.g., the channel length of MOSFETs and their progress since the invention of MOSFET, would be greatly appreciated.
